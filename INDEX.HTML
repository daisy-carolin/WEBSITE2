       <div id ="About">AkiraChix was founded in 2010 by a group of women 
        who were passionate about changing the landscape of the technology 
        field and creating a community that supports, connects and inspires
         women in the tech space. These young women challenged the status
          quo by encouraging and facilitating more women to take up careers
           in technology-related fields. Its vision has continued to be led
            by Linda Kamau and Marie Githinji, who have committed to champion
            the diversity and inclusion of women in the technical workforce,
             changing the economic capabilities of young women as well as shifting 
             societal norms. AkiraChix has come a long way from its beginnings, where 
             we trained young women from Nairobi in a bus fitted with computers, to a 
             fully-fledged residential campus with a goal of serving young women from 
             all over Kenya and other African Countries.The organization offers the following courses.</p>
